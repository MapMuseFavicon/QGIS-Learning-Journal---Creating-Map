# QGIS-Learning-Journal---Creating-Map
Documenting my QGIS progress with Discover QGIS Workbook: data loading, CRS, symbology, and map creation. Code, project files, and reflections included.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Loaded Data**:  
   - Added shapefiles (e.g., `Canada.shp`, `Mexico.shp`, `Eastern_state_land_ownership.shp`, `American_black_bear_east_coast.shp`).  
2. **Set Project CRS**:  
   - Used `EPSG:4326`
3. **Applied Symbology**:  
   - Styled layers with custom colors according to standard BLM colors, labels, and rule-based formatting.  
4. **Created a Map**:  
   - Added a title, legend, scale bar, and north arrow.  
   - Exported as `Black-Bear-Habitat.jpg` at high resolution of 300dpi.
